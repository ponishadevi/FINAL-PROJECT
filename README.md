    Project objective:
					This project aims to build a comprehensive Plotly Dashboard to analyze and improve Zomato's business. The dashboard will provide valuable insights for 
    stakeholders, including restaurants, food industry players, and investors. The combination of data analysis and visualization will contribute to making informed 
    decisions and enhancing Zomato's overall performance.
       
    Access the Plotly Dashboard locally at http://127.0.0.1:8050/.   
    
    Approach:
    Data Cleaning and Exploration (Step 1):
    Load and clean the missing values: The dataset was loaded, and missing values were addressed through various techniques, ensuring a clean and complete dataset.
    
    Explore data analysis: An exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset's features, distributions, and potential patterns. This step 
    laid the foundation for the subsequent development of the Plotly Dashboard.
    
    Dashboard Development (Step 2):
    Features of the Plotly Dashboard:
    Dropdown for country-specific data: Users can select a country from a dropdown to view specific data.
    
    Two charts of choice: Any two charts, such as count, total sales, favorite cuisines, etc., will be included.
    
    Find costly cuisines in India: A chart will display the costliest cuisines in India.
    
    Filter based on the city: Users can filter data based on city.
    
    Famous cuisine in the city: Identify the famous cuisine in a selected city.
    
    Costlier cuisine: Display the costlier cuisine in a selected city.
    
    Rating count in the city: Show a chart based on rating tests in a selected city.
    
    Pie chart for online delivery vs dine-in: Visualize the distribution of online delivery vs dine-in.
    
    Comparison between cities in India: Generate a report comparing different cities in India.
    
    Online delivery spending by region: Determine which part of India spends more on online delivery.
    
    Dine-in spending by region: Identify which part of India spends more on dine-in.
    
    High vs low living cost: Compare living costs in different parts of India.
    
    Dashboard Deployment (Task 3):
    The final step involves hosting and deploying the Plotly Dashboard onto a web app server.
